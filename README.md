# README

So many apps need some kind of chat functionality these days. But what
do you do if you want the freedom to avoid vendor lock-in? There are
multitudes of Firebase based chat app starters. What we want to do is
make something high quality that can be deployed on a variety of cloud
providers easily. Mayim means water in Hebrew, what do you put out a
fire with?

We also intend to integrate Agora.io video and audio calling as a
standard (optional) feature. If you like or use the code please join our
little mitzvah and help contribute!
